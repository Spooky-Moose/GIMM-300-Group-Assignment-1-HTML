            <h3>Favorite Games</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Halo</li>
                <li>Fallout New Vegas</li>

            <h3>Games That Suck</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ride To Hell: Retribution</b></li>
                <p>There is no argument. This game is terrible. I'd spend my time explaining it but simply watching gameplay of it will show you how bad it is.</p>
                <li><b>Tactical Intervention</b></li>
                <p>This was quite an ambitious source game that may have been a bit too ambitious. It was nothing more than a CSGO clone with too many mechanics and features that just didn't work.</p>
                <li><b>The Urbz</b></li>
                <p>For any fans of The Sim's series, this was the weird Sims 2 console port that wasn't Sims 2 at all. The Urbz was just a weird, stripped down version of The Sims 2 that played really hard on popular movie and media trends at the time. Not
                    too great.</p>
